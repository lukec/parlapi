To setup Parlapi:

Choose a place that the web server will run (eg: parlapi user).

git clone git://github.com/lukec/parlapi.git
cd parlapi

Create a database:
* sudo -u postgres createdb -E utf8 parlapi
* sudo -u postgres createuser parlapi
** For developer environments, call it $USER_parlapi
* sudo vi /etc/postgresql/8.3/main/pg_hba.conf 
** Let the parlapi user access the parlapi DB

Load the schema:
* psql -f etc/sql/schema.sql

Load the data:
* bin/update-db
OR load from an existing DB (much faster)
* pg_dump --no-owner --clean lukec_parlapi > /tmp/parlapi.dump (as lukec)
* psql -f /tmp/parlapi.dump (as you)

Launch it:
* plackup -r --port 5002
** the -r will cause plackup to look for locally modified files and auto-reload itself
